&lt;p&gt;I've met up with Ian and packed our bags and we're finally headed to New Zealand. It's a country that I've wanted to visit for a long time and it's the first international trip that I'm taking with Ian alone so we should be in for a fun ride. We're road tripping along the West coast of the South Island of New Zealand, starting at Queentown and eventually making our way up to Nelson. Here's the day by day plan for this New Zealand trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hop on a plane on the 16th but we won't land until the 18th. So we immediately lose
a couple of days during our 13.5 hour flight from Los Angeles to Auckland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We take a flight from Auckland to Queenstown - so we'll arrive at our first true
destination in New Zealand around noon on the 18th. We'll then pick up our rental car,
buy some groceries, and spend the day exploring Queenstown. We have a reservation at the
Blue Kanu in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hike near Queenstown in the morning, drive to Te Anau in the afternoon, and visit the Te Anau Glowworm caves in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend the full day hiking in Fjordlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive up to the area surrounding Fox Glacier (this is the longest drive in this trip) and settle into our temporary home in Okarito&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hike in Tai Poutini all day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do some sightseeing along the drive to our next place at Tutaki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hike the Mt Robert Circuit in Nelson Lakes National Park and make our way to Nelson for a nice dinner in the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent a bike and cycle the great taste trail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly to Auckland, do a walking tour, be tourists in New Zealand's LA-equivalent sprawling city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly back to the USA and part ways&lt;/li&gt;
