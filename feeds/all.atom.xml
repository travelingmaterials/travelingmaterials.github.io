&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 6:30 am because apparently I am a perfectly calibrated clock with no jet lag. This was just in time to get blown away by the ludicrous sunrise that was happening just outside the AirBNB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ready" src="images/nz003.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd both had some pretty stressful weeks leading up to this vacation, so I think we started the flights feeling a little more tense than usual. But ultimately everything went totally fine and I really just want to show you some pictures that we took out the airplane window during landing. New Zealand is truly as beautiful as advertised. It's just stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="auckland" src="images/nz004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's Auckland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queenstown, in particular, has these dramatic steep mountains, lush hills, and clear blue lake that just looks painted on. It’s nonsense beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="queenstown1" src="images/nz005.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And here's Queenstown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="queenstown2" src="images/nz006.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And here's the view from our AirBNB. It's bonkers pretty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we picked up the rental car, drove into town (on the left side of the road, mind you, which even after a day still fells deeply wrong), ate some savory lamb pies, checked into our AirBNB for a quick rest, and bought some groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rose garden" src="images/nz007.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it was back into town to tour the public gardens, eat a nice Polynesian dinner, and take a lot more photos. I can’t get over how amazingly crazy beautiful this place is.&lt;/p&gt;

In between, we got to hang out at the San Jose airport lounge, had three flights (which were all delayed either leaving or getting to their gate), crossed the dateline (so we completely missed the 17th), and had to have our hiking boots cleaned by New Zeland border patrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've met up with Ian and packed our bags and we're finally headed to New Zealand. It's a country that I've wanted to visit for a long time and it's the first international trip that I'm taking with Ian alone so we should be in for a fun ride. We're road tripping along the West coast of the South Island of New Zealand, starting at Queentown and eventually making our way up to Nelson. Here's the day by day plan for this New Zealand trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hop on a plane on the 16th but we won't land until the 18th. So we immediately lose
a couple of days during our 13.5 hour flight from Los Angeles to Auckland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We take a flight from Auckland to Queenstown - so we'll arrive at our first true
destination in New Zealand around noon on the 18th. We'll then pick up our rental car,
buy some groceries, and spend the day exploring Queenstown. We have a reservation at the
Blue Kanu in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hike near Queenstown in the morning, drive to Te Anau in the afternoon, and visit the Te Anau Glowworm caves in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend the full day hiking in Fjordlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive up to the area surrounding Fox Glacier (this is the longest drive in this trip) and settle into our temporary home in Okarito&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hike in Tai Poutini all day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do some sightseeing along the drive to our next place at Tutaki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hike the Mt Robert Circuit in Nelson Lakes National Park and make our way to Nelson for a nice dinner in the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent a bike and cycle the great taste trail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly to Auckland, do a walking tour, be tourists in New Zealand's LA-equivalent sprawling city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly back to the USA and part ways&lt;/li&gt;
