	<h2>That Sunrise, Man</h2>
<p>I woke up at 6:30 am because apparently I am a perfectly calibrated clock with no jet lag. This was just in time to get blown away by the ludicrous sunrise that was happening just outside the AirBNB. </p>
<p><img alt="ready" src="images/nz003.jpg"></p>
<p>We'd both had some pretty stressful weeks leading up to this vacation, so I think we started the flights feeling a little more tense than usual. But ultimately everything went totally fine and I really just want to show you some pictures that we took out the airplane window during landing. New Zealand is truly as beautiful as advertised. It's just stunning.</p>
<p><img alt="auckland" src="images/nz004.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Here's Auckland</em></p>
<p>Queenstown, in particular, has these dramatic steep mountains, lush hills, and clear blue lake that just looks painted on. It’s nonsense beautiful.</p>
<p><img alt="queenstown1" src="images/nz005.jpg">
<em>And here's Queenstown</em></p>
<p><img alt="queenstown2" src="images/nz006.jpg">
<em>And here's the view from our AirBNB. It's bonkers pretty.</em></p>
<p>So we picked up the rental car, drove into town (on the left side of the road, mind you, which even after a day still fells deeply wrong), ate some savory lamb pies, checked into our AirBNB for a quick rest, and bought some groceries.</p>

<p>And then it was back into town to tour the public gardens, eat a nice Polynesian dinner, and take a lot more photos. I can’t get over how amazingly crazy beautiful this place is.</p>
