			<h2>The Long Night</h2>
<p><img alt="luggage" src="images/nz002.jpg"></p>
<p>We entered San Jose's airport at around 4 pm on the afternoon of the 16th and left Queenstown's airport at around 1 pm on the afternnon of the 18th. So just getting here was a sizable adventure. We got to hang out at the lounge at San Jose's airport and enjoy the free-of-charge snacks and beverages, we got delayed on each flight in our sequence of flights and therefore experienced some fairly tense, tight layovers in between the flights, and we got high quantities (if not quality) of sleep.</p>
<p><img alt="ready" src="images/nz003.jpg"></p>
<p>We'd both had some pretty stressful weeks leading up to this vacation, so I think we started the flights feeling a little more tense than usual. But ultimately everything went totally fine and I really just want to show you some pictures that we took out the airplane window during landing. New Zealand is truly as beautiful as advertised. It's just stunning.</p>

<p><em>Here's Auckland</em></p>
<p>Queenstown in particular has this dramatic steep mountains, lush hills, and clear blue lake thing going for it that just looks painted on. It's nonsense beautiful.</p>

			<h2>Just you wait</h2>
<p><img alt="waiting" src="images/nz001.jpg"></p>
<p>I've met up with Ian and packed our bags and we're finally headed to New Zealand. It's a country that I've wanted to visit for a long time and it's the first international trip that I'm taking with Ian alone so we should be in for a fun ride. We're road tripping along the West coast of the South Island of New Zealand, starting at Queentown and eventually making our way up to Nelson. Here's the day by day plan for this New Zealand trip.</p>
<ol>
<li>We hop on a plane on the 16th but we won't land until the 18th. So we immediately lose
a couple of days during our 13.5 hour flight from Los Angeles to Auckland</li>
<li>We take a flight from Auckland to Queenstown - so we'll arrive at our first true
destination in New Zealand around noon on the 18th. We'll then pick up our rental car,
buy some groceries, and spend the day exploring Queenstown. We have a reservation at the
Blue Kanu in the evening.</li>
<li>Hike near Queenstown in the morning, drive to Te Anau in the afternoon, and visit the Te Anau Glowworm caves in the evening.</li>
<li>Spend the full day hiking in Fjordlands</li>
<li>Drive up to the area surrounding Fox Glacier (this is the longest drive in this trip) and settle into our temporary home in Okarito</li>
<li>Hike in Tai Poutini all day</li>
<li>Do some sightseeing along the drive to our next place at Tutaki</li>
<li>Hike the Mt Robert Circuit in Nelson Lakes National Park and make our way to Nelson for a nice dinner in the city</li>
<li>Rent a bike and cycle the great taste trail</li>
<li>Fly to Auckland, do a walking tour, be tourists in New Zealand's LA-equivalent sprawling city</li>
<li>Fly back to the USA and part ways</li>
</ol>
